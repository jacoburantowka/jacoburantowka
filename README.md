# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jacob, lovely to meet you!

I combine my creative past with in-depth knowledge of the UX to build accessible and elegant user interfaces, data dashboards, and web applications.
These days you can find me building 3D Visual Commerce products at **Fixtuur**.

Other than being your QA team's favourite developer, I'm also an award winning sound designer, a dad to three cats, and a big fan of Dungeons & Dragons.
